- sort out header architecture. I think I'll need wrappers for the D3DX structs (done...ish)

- decide on a Mock or TDD framework. (current thought: outside-in TDD with mostly stubs; mocks only when necessary.)

- Find a way inject/use a stub class. Experiment with it.

- Write a unit test for one of the user stories.

- Implement class enough to pass test.  make sure class implementations allow for dependency injection.  outside-in TDD should enforce this.

- Rinse, repeat
